 * Provides common utility classes.

 * <p>It is recommended that the classes in this package do NOT have any
 * knowledge regarding even NicoCache. In other words, the classes
 * should be able to be reused in other projects, which include
 * NicoCache derivatives. It also helps to avoid conflict among derivatives.</p>

 * <p>This package is the most bottom layer in the architecture.
 *  Therefore, this package should not refer any other packages.</p>
